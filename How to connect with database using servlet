All code are written in java inside java-servlet-class.

Step 1:- create a servlet ( I am using Eclipse IDE, it make it easier to perform those task and I had done internship of java developer using it so I'm
quite familiar with it).

Step 2:- I mostly use doPost() method in the servlet, as it hides the information of the user who is making the request. Inside doPost() method..
first load the JDBC driver (Java Database Connection Driver) and other stuffs.. as follows:

response.setContentType("text/html"); // Type of content
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

// Name of parameter that you will get through the request made by user, to store them we create string variables... You can create as many as you want.
String <name> =request.getParameter("<parameter_name>");

// write the below code inside try-catch block
// Load Drivers
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
// Create Connection
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/3306/<DB_name>","<user_name_of_sql>(can be root by default","<password of user>");
// Create statement or Prepare Statement
PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement("<enter your query like: insert into table values(?,?,?...etc.)>");

// After preparing the statement you set those variable values using the same stmt statement
stmt.setString(1, <variable 1>);
...etc. //variable should be set order wise don't set them randomly. In an order which you create the table with.

// After that you are mostly done, but while writing those above code the IDE will show error, so just hover over them and it will show you to import respective
// libraries/class related to those functions.
// If you want to check if any update occured or not then..
int i = 0;
if(i>0){
  out.println("Operation done.."); // can use this code
}
else{
// you can write anything you want. 
}
